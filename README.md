                <p>During fall semester last year, I developed a practical application called the Benson's Kiosk Management App. 
                    This project aimed to assist Mr. Benson, the owner of a small kiosk, in efficiently managing his business operations. Here is what the app does:</p>
                <li><h5>Features</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sales and Purchases Tracking
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>The app allows record for new daily sales and purchases. 
                                    Gives the capability to input the quantity and price of items sold and purchased</p></li>
                            <li><p>It computes the total sales and total purchases for each day, providing Mr. Benson with a clear overview of his business transactions.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Profit Calculation
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Based on the sales and purchase data, the app automatically calculates the daily profit. 
                                It subtracts the total purchase cost from the total sales revenue</p></li>
                            <li><p>Mr. Benson can quickly assess how well his kiosk is performing financially.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>File Storage for future Retrivals
                        <ul>
                            <li>The app maintains a digital record of daily transactions. 
                                Each day’s data is stored in a file</li>
                            <li>Mr. Benson can easily retrieve historical information whenever needed. 
                                Whether it’s for tax purposes or business analysis, the app ensures that crucial data is organized and accessible.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Note
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Program uses a command-line interface and stores file in form of a text file</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul></li>
                </ul></li>
          </div>
            <li><h4>Other Practice</h4>
                <ul>
                    <p>I have also done other simple practice projects in python, html,css,javascript, and c++. 
                        These serves the purpose of sharpening my coding skills.
